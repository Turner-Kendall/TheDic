# TheDic.Site
## The simplest web dictionary.

### A Minimal Vue 3 SPA to search a dictionary
#### My goal was to create a simple and efficient web dictionary, that could all happen on the front end, in 24 hours.

TheDic.Site accomplishes these goals-ish;  I included getting the domain, setting up the repository, etc. in the 24 hours.  I ganked and carved up the Bootstrap css (only) file and did the vite@latest deal. The only dependency is SweetAlert2.  The initial dic data came from HuggyFace.

- You need to run -  ```npm run dev```  to get Vite running your Vue instance at http://localhost:5173/

##### todo

- re bug?  While attempting to limit what kinda data is being passed around I am trying to do validation on the search input without a library but something is amiss.

I deployed it to Cloudflare within the 24 hours :)
