# TheDic.Site
## The simplest web dictionary.

### A Minimal Vue 3 SPA to search a dictionary
#### My goal was to create a simple and efficient web dictionary, that could all happen on the front end, in 24 hours.

TheDic.Site accomplishes these goals-ish;  I included getting the domain, setting up the repository, etc. in the 24 hours.  I ganked and carved up the Bootstrap css file and did the vite@latest deal. The only dependency is SweetAlert2.
