### It's a dictionary...

Does the Internet need a non-biased, fast, open dictionary?  Hell Yeah it does.
- It's fast.
- It's simple
- It's created by and for it's users. 

The frontend is Vue3, the backend is Node + Express.  Yes, there are many new API packages, and I could have
written it in Go ( good idea for v2 ) but I created this is about 6 hours...

### How to use it:
You'll need to first run

```npm install```

In the backend and front end directories

---

and then you be able to run the development server ( in both directories )

```npm run dev```

So open 2 terminal windows.  One in the frontend directory and one in the backend directory.  Do the npm run dev in both.

---


and then you will be able to create the finished version of the front end with:

```npm run build```
